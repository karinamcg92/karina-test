Just a test repo!

Feel free to play around making commits to get familiar with how it works.

Some basic GIT commands:<br /><br />
Commit Changes<br />
git status - List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit<br />
git add * /or/ git add <filename> - Add one or more files<br />
git commit -m "your commit message" - Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository<br />
git commit -a - Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then<br />
git push origin master - Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository<br /><br />
  
Creating Branches<br />
git checkout -b <branchname> - Create a new branch and switch to it<br />
git checkout <branchname> - Switch from one branch to another<br />
