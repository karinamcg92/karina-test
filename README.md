Just a test repo!

Feel free to play around making commits to get familiar with how it works.

Some basic GIT commands:

Commit Changes
git status - List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit
git add * /or/ git add <filename> - Add one or more files
git commit -m "your commit message" - Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository
git commit -a - Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then
git push origin master - Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository
  
Creating Branches
git checkout -b <branchname> - Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout <branchname> - Switch from one branch to another
